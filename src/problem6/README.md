## Features

- Real-time updates to a top 10 scoreboard
- Secure and authenticated score submissions
- Prevention of unauthorized score manipulation
- High concurrency support for multiple users
- Efficient caching for fast leaderboard access

## API Endpoints

## Database Schema

### User Table
- id: Unique identifier (Primary Key)
- username: Player's username
- score: Current user score

### Leaderboard Table
- id: Auto-increment identifier (Primary Key)
- userId: Foreign key to User table
- score: Qualifying score for the leaderboard
- timestamp: Score update time

## Security Measures

- JWT or OAuth2 authentication
- Server-side validation of score submissions
- Rate limiting to prevent malicious requests
- Monitoring of abnormal score updates

## Performance Considerations

- In-memory caching (e.g., Redis) for fast leaderboard access
- Concurrent update handling
- Database indexing on the score column for optimized queries

## Future Improvements

- Leaderboard pagination
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Historical data tracking for user scores
- Time-based leaderboards (e.g., weekly scores)
